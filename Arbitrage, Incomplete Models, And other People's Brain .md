#Arbitrage, Incomplete Models. And other People's Brain
##Summary

### 1. Introduction
* Introduction of rational choice. Rational choice theory is founded on the principles of methodological individualism and purposive action.
* Theory of methodological individualism: social and economic phenomena are explained in terms of “a particular configuration of individuals, their dispositions, situations, beliefs and physical resources and environment”.
* Arbitrage choice theory, a new synthesis of rational choice that weakens the emphasis on methodological individualism and purposive action and departs from the traditional use of preference as a behavioral primitive.

### 2. The standard Theory of Rational Choice
1. Environment:
  * Alternative: An event that is under an agent’s control.
  * State of nature: An event that is under nature’s control.
  * Outcome: A realization of events.

2. Behavior: Physical behavior and preference behavior.
  * Physical behavior: affects the outcomes of events. Physical behavior by agents consists of choices among feasible alternatives.
  * Preference behavior: modeled in rational choice theory.

3. Rationality: behave rationally are imposed at several levels: individual rationality; strategic rationality; competitive or social rationality.

### 3. Arbitrage Choice Theory (ACT)
**A reformulation of rational choice that circumvents the difficulties of the standard theory.**

* First, every agent individually must behave in a manner that maximizes expected utility with respect to some probability distribution and utility function.
* Second, the agents jointly must behave as if implementing a competitive equilibrium in a market or a strategic equilibrium in a game.
* Third, where uncertainty is involved, there must exist a “common prior” probability distribution.
* Fourth, where agents anticipate the receipt of information, they must expect their beliefs to be updated according to Bayes Theorem.

### 4. Incomplete Models and Other People’s Brains
* This model unsatisfying for the agent fail to get a unique recommended solution from the model. Lack of analysis for dynamic variable.
* The preceding description of the decision making process suggests that all decisions are to some extent group decisions, and they are acts of creation and discovery, not merely acts of selection.

### 5. The Limits of Theory
*  To be applied quantitatively, arbitrage choice theory requires a certain degree of completeness:  events must be well-defined and contingent trades must be possible, or at least imaginable, with respect to those events.

### 6. Implications for Modeling
* First, decision analysis should embrace the idea that decisions are inherently interactive rather than celebrate the heroically rational individual.
* Second, a novel approach to the modeling of games of strategy is suggested:  let the common knowledge assumptions be translated into gambles or trades that the players are willing to publicly accept.

###Question:
* Arbitrage avoid trouble merely by making weaker assumptions and not trying to predict exactly what every agent will do in every situation. My question is market reflect the choice of majority investors. Will you have a wrong prediction if you not trying to predict every agent do in situations?
