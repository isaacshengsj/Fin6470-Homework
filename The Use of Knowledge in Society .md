# The Use of Knowledge in Society
## Summary

* The economic problem of society is not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources, rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society. It is a problem of the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality.

* The primary problem that Hayek trying to deal is about rational economic organization.

* The goal for both allocation of available resources and utilizing knowledge initially dispersed among all the people are actually trying to be efficient economic system.

* Scientific knowledge is a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body o very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules.

* There are less decisions are made by “planners” who trying to allocate or utilize resources. But the decision are made by people who can aggregate and analyses more detail to make detailed economic plan, which means economic decisions are required at long intervals.

* Hayek thinks the reason that economists are increasingly apt to forget about the constant small changes is because economists put too much attention on growing preoccupation with statistical aggregates.

* Economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place. In order to solve this problem, we need some form of decentralization (clear division of labor) to ensure knowledge of particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used.

* In a system where the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coordinate the parts of his plan. Means price can reflect the people how to react on the information.

* One information dispersed will also influence the whole economic system. The example of tin shows that the effect of price of tin will rapidly spread throughout the whole economic system and influence not only all the uses of tin but also those of its substitutes and the substitutes of substitutes etc.

### Question:
* This paper talks about the function of price and the influences. Hayek think the price is the reflection of people’s reaction on information. But there is still a lot of facts that obey this rule or take advantage of this rule. So my question is: is it good that someone can adjust the market when things goes abnormal?
