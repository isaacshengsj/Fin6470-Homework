#What Should Economists Do?
###Summary

The author want economists to quit concerning with allocation problems, with the problem, as it has been traditionally defined. Because when the problem has been established in allocation terms, our whole study becomes one of applied maximization of a relatively simple computational sort.

Economists “should” concentrate their attention on a particular form of human activity, and upon the various institutional arrangements that arise as a result of this form of activity.

*The elementary and basic approach that I suggest places "the theory of markets" and not the "theory of resource allocation" at center stage.

>Economists subject field is a problem or set of problems, not a characteristic form of human activity.

*It is thus by quite natural or normal extension that the economic problem moves from that one which is confronted by the individual person to that facing the larger family group, the business firm, the trade union, the trade association, the church, the local community, the regional or state government, the national government, and, finally, the world (tightly connected; the economic problem can spread to a world problem from an individual problem.)

*In the Knightian introduction to our subject we talk about the "social organiza- tion" that performs these five familiar _social_ functions.

*Society as the entity that confronts the economic problem about which we, as professional economists, should be concerned. "Society," as such, must always be conceived in terms of its individual members.

*The utilitarians tried to cross the bridge by summing utilities has the open ended to promote the research on social welfare functions, which gives great support on economic research.

###Distinctions between economic and technological problem:
*An economic problem arises when mutually conflicting ends are present, when choices must be made among them.
*A technological problem, by comparison, is characterized by the fact that there is only one end to be maximized. There is a single best or optimal solution.

The theory of choice must be removed from its position of eminence in the economist's thought processes. Because it assumes no special role for the economist, as opposed to any other scientist who examines human behavior.

*Use market of competitive to proof the model has limits because the model is assuming the market has no competition. The market becomes competitive comes to be established as institutions emerge to place limits on individual behavior patterns.

*The author thinks the market organization is not a means toward the accomplishment of anything. It is the institutional embodiment of the voluntary exchange processes that are entered into by individuals in their several capacities.

*The motivation for individuals to engage in trade is that of “efficiency,” defined in the personal sense of moving from less preferred to more preferred positions and doing so under mutually acceptable terms.

*The author propose to extend the system of human relationships brought within the economist’s scope widely enough to include collective as well as private organization. Reason: Economics is the study of the whole system of exchange relation- ships. Politics is the study of the whole system of coercive or potentially coercive relationships. Man has available to him alternatives of action, he meets his associates as, in some sense, an "equal," in other words, in a trading relationship. Only in those situations where pure rent is the sole element in return is the economic relationship wholly replaced by the political.

###Question:
After reading this paper I think I have better understanding on “efficiency” and I think the author not just trying to say what economists should research but also trying to let economists give the result economically. So what kind of idea belongs to an economic result? Is that the result about trading and marketing efficiency?
